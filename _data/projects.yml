  name: 'Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Distributed MIMO wireless communication system'
  description: >
    My bachelor's thesis focuses on developing a non-data-aided iteration maximum likelihood solution to estimate channel parameters over fast MIMO channels in OFDM system based on Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
    The biggest challenge is to minimize the mean square error between the simulation 'real' data and the estimated results based on the multiple interchannel interference.
    Besides, I also designed a Kalman filter estimator in the state space type of the channel based on auto-regression model.
    Finally, I made an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence rate of the designed estimator.
